# Model Predictive Control (MPC) Demo

Iterative Model Predictive Control for a bicycle-like vehicle, built for research, learning, and rapid prototyping.

This repository demonstrates an iterative convex MPC workflow using CVXPY and OSQP. It includes a headless simulation mode for analysis and logging, plus an optional MuJoCo visualization demo.

## Why this repository exists

The goal is to provide a compact, research-friendly implementation of:

- a bicycle kinematic model,
- iterative linearization-based MPC,
- quadratic cost optimization over a prediction horizon,
- obstacle avoidance through convexified constraints,
- reference generation for circular and waypoint trajectories.

The implementation is designed for rapid experimentation, reproducibility, and easy extension.

## Key features

- Iterative MPC with warm-started optimization and SQP early-exit convergence
- Headless simulation demo with plotting, CSV logging, and performance metrics
- Optional obstacle avoidance via linearized constraints (soft slack formulation)
- Multiple reference trajectory modes: circle, waypoints, figure-8, and lane-change
- MuJoCo visualization demo for interactive playback
- `MPCRunner` wrapper class for clean simulation loop reuse in scripts and tests
- Lightweight utility modules for dynamics, linearization, and reference generation
- Unit tests for solver robustness, metrics, and trajectory builders

## Installation

Recommended Python version: `3.11+`.

Install dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or create a Conda environment:

```bash
conda env create -f env.yml
conda activate mpc_python
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install the package locally:

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
```

## Running demos

### Headless demo

```bash
python mpc_python/mpc_demo_nosim.py
```

This runs the MPC controller in simulation, plots trajectory and control signals, and optionally saves history to CSV.

### Run as a package or installed script

If the package is installed locally, you can also run the headless demo as a Python module:

```bash
python -m mpc_python
```

Or use the provided console scripts after installation:

```bash
mpc-demo-nosim
mpc-demo-mujoco
```

These commands launch the same entry points as the demo scripts.

### Headless demo with CSV output

```bash
python mpc_python/mpc_demo_nosim.py --save-log logs/mpc_history.csv
```

### Obstacle avoidance

```bash
python mpc_python/mpc_demo_nosim.py --obstacle-avoidance
```

### MuJoCo visualization demo

```bash
python mpc_python/mpc_demo_mujoco.py
```

MuJoCo requires a working installation and proper environment variables.

## Configuration details

### `config/mpc.yaml`

Key options:

- `horizon` — prediction horizon length
- `weights` — penalties on tracking and control effort
- `constraints` — velocity, acceleration, steering, and steering rate limits
- `solver_options` — optional CVXPY solver settings
- `obstacle_margin` — safety buffer for obstacle avoidance
- `obstacle_slack` — enable soft obstacle constraints
- `obstacle_slack_weight` — penalty for slack violation

### `config/simulation.yaml`

## Core algorithm overview

1. Create a reference trajectory from a circular path or waypoints.
2. Initialize vehicle state and warm-start inputs.
3. Linearize the bicycle dynamics around the predicted trajectory.
4. Build a convex QP with state, control, and obstacle constraints.
5. Solve the QP using OSQP and update the control sequence.
6. Apply the first command, simulate one step, and repeat.

config = load_yaml("config/mpc.yaml")
mpc = IterativeMPC(config)
reference = build_circular_reference(n_points=300, radius=8.0, speed=1.5, dt=config["dt"])

x0 = [reference[0, 0] - 0.5, reference[0, 1], reference[0, 2], 0.2]
runner = MPCRunner(mpc, reference, x0, wheelbase=config.get("wheelbase", 0.16))
history = runner.run(n_steps=200)

# Print performance metrics
summarize(history, config.get("constraints", {}))
```

## Testing

Run the test suite with:

```bash
python -m pytest -q
```

## Troubleshooting

### Missing CVXPY

Install CVXPY and OSQP if the solver import fails:

```bash
python -m pip install cvxpy osqp
```

### MuJoCo issues

If MuJoCo fails to launch, verify the installation and environment variables.


- the `mujoco` Python package is installed,
- MuJoCo binaries are installed on your machine,
- required environment variables such as `MUJOCO_PY_MJPRO_PATH` or newer MuJoCo paths are configured.

## Research guidance

To use this repository for AI/control research:

- vary `config/mpc.yaml` weights and examine the resulting trajectory quality,
- change `config/simulation.yaml` obstacle layouts to test robustness,
- compare this iterative MPC approach against a nonlinear MPC baseline,
- log results to CSV and analyze tracking error, control effort, and constraint satisfaction,
- add new reference generators or dynamics models for system identification studies.
